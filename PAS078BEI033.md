# Question: Describe and discuss the use case of following:


## 1. fork()

The `fork()` system call is essential in operating systems for creating new processes. It clones the calling process, resulting in a new process known as the child process, while the original is termed the parent process. The `fork()` call is utilized to spawn a new process that runs concurrently with the parent process. Once the child process is created, both the parent and child processes continue executing from the instruction following the `fork()` call.

## 2. exec()

The `exec()` family of functions replaces the current process image with a new one. It runs an executable file within the context of the current process, thereby overwriting the previous executable. This functionality is often used to replace the current running process with a new process, effectively terminating the current process and starting a new one.

## 3. getpid()

The `getpid()` function is straightforward and requires no arguments. It returns the Process ID (PID) of the calling process. In a scenario where a parent process creates a child process using `fork()`, `getpid()` can be used to retrieve the PID of the process, aiding in the management and coordination between the parent and child processes.

## 4. wait()

The `wait()` function is used by a parent process to wait for its child processes to complete. When the parent process calls `wait()`, it suspends its execution until one of its child processes exits or a signal is caught. This function is crucial in scenarios where a parent process needs to manage multiple child processes, ensuring proper synchronization by waiting for each child process to terminate.

## 5. stat()

The `stat()` function retrieves detailed information about a file or directory, including size, permissions, ownership, and timestamps. It is commonly used in system programming and file management. By calling `stat()`, information about a file is stored in a structure that includes various attributes of the file, facilitating detailed file management operations.

## 6. opendir()

The `opendir()` function opens a directory stream, which can then be used to read the directory's contents using functions like `readdir()` and to close the stream with `closedir()`. This function is typically used in applications that need to analyze or manage directory contents, such as file managers, backup tools, or custom scripts.

## 7. readdir()

The `readdir()` function reads entries from a directory stream that was opened with `opendir()`. It allows for iterating through directory contents and retrieving information about each file or subdirectory. This is useful for applications that need to list and process files in a directory.

## 8. close()

The `close()` function is used to close a file descriptor, which is an integer handle used by the operating system to reference an open file, socket, or other I/O resource. Closing a file descriptor releases the associated resources. It is important for ensuring that system resources are properly managed and not left open, which could lead to resource leaks.

# C Program for Producer-Consumer Problem

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Initialize a mutex variable to 1
int mutex = 1;

// Number of full slots initialized to 0
int full = 0;

// Number of empty slots set to buffer size
int empty = 10, item = 0;

// Function to produce an item and add it to the buffer
void producer() {
    --mutex;  // Lock the mutex
    ++full;   // Increase the count of full slots
    --empty;  // Decrease the count of empty slots
    item++;
    printf("\nProducer produces item %d", item);
    ++mutex;  // Unlock the mutex
}

// Function to consume an item and remove it from the buffer
void consumer() {
    --mutex;  // Lock the mutex
    --full;   // Decrease the count of full slots
    ++empty;  // Increase the count of empty slots
    printf("\nConsumer consumes item %d", item);
    item--;
    ++mutex;  // Unlock the mutex
}

int main() {
    int choice;
    while (1) {
        printf("\n1. Press 1 for Producer");
        printf("\n2. Press 2 for Consumer");
        printf("\n3. Press 3 for Exit");
        printf("\nEnter your choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);

        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                if (mutex == 1 && empty != 0) {
                    producer();
                } else {
                    printf("Buffer is full!");
                }
                break;
            case 2:
                if (mutex == 1 && full != 0) {
                    consumer();
                } else {
                    printf("Buffer is empty!");
                }
                break;
            case 3:
                exit(0);
                break;
            default:
                printf("Invalid choice! Please try again.");
                break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
